In this folder are the container files for our App Engine deployment container. We would like to note we did not create the application this container runs, we simply created
the container files and modified one line of the original applications setting.py file. Full credits go to the GitHub user "lambrou", and the source code for this vulnerable Django
application can be found at the following link:
