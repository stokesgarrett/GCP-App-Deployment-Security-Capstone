# GCP App Deployment & Security Capstone

## Objective

The GCP Application Deployment and Security Analysis project focused on deploying and conducting security assessments on three containerized applications using three distinct deployment methods in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The project utilized GCP services such as Kubernetes, App Engine, Cloud Run, and Cloud Functions to deploy functional applications. Post-deployment, independent security analyses were performed using six different vulnerability assessment tools, with results compared and contrasted. This hands-on project enhanced understanding of cloud-based application deployment and security, specifically within GCP..

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of cloud application deployments, with hands-on experience.
- Proficiency in deploying and managing applications using GCP services: Kubernetes, App Engine, Cloud Run, and Cloud Functions.
- Expertise in containerizing applications for scalable and efficient deployment.
- In-depth knowledge of vulnerability assessment tools for securing cloud environments.
- Strong critical thinking and problem-solving abilities in cloud cybersecurity analysis.

### Tools Used

- Development and Containerization: Utilized Docker, GitHub, and Visual Studio Code for containerizing applications in preparation for deployment.
- Cloud Deployment: Leveraged GCP services including Kubernetes, App Engine, Cloud Run, and Cloud Functions to deploy containerized applications.
- Security Analysis: Employed security tools such as Artifact Registry, OWASP ZAP, Pentest Tools, Trivy, ImmuniWeb, and Quttera for vulnerability discovery and reporting in containerized application deployments.
- Learning Resources: Consulted Google Cloud Documentation and YouTube for guidance on performing specific project tasks.
