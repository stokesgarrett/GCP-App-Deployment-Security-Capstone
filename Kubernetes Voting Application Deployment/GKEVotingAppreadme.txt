This directory contains the pod and service files that were accessed using kubectl in our Kubernetes cluster to create the pods and services within the cluster. It should be noted we did not create the
actual voting application, or the images the pod files reference, we simply created the pod and service yml files to deploy the application. All credits for the creation of the sample voting application 
go to Docker Samples, which this application is found in at the following location - https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app
