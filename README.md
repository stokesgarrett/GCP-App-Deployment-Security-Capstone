# GCP App Deployment & Security Capstone

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The GCP Application Deployment and Security Analysis project focused on deploying and conducting security assessments on three containerized applications using three distinct deployment methods in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The project utilized GCP services such as Kubernetes, App Engine, Cloud Run, and Cloud Functions to deploy functional applications. Post-deployment, independent security analyses were performed using six different vulnerability assessment tools, with results compared and contrasted. This hands-on project enhanced understanding of cloud-based application deployment and security, specifically within GCP..
